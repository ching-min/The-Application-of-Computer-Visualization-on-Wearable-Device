# The-Application-of-Computer-Visualization-on-Wearable-Device
In the project, we wanted to create a simple wearable device which can identify people’s face. The project can be separate into three parts: client side (camera), connection side (transmit the data and provide Wi-Fi), and server side (face identification). I was in charge of server side. When camera catches an image, it would be transmitted to connection side, and the picture would be further transmitted to server side. Server side would detect people’s face and frame people’s face with red block, and compare the face with the data which is already stored in database. If the face can match the one in database, then the device will show the name beside the red block.
In this side, I provide the code of server side.
